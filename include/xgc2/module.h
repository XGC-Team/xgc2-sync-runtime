/*
 * xgc2/module.h - xgc2-module ABI v2 (binding contract for #226/#219).
 *
 * A module is a shared library exporting `const xgc2_module_desc* xgc2_module_v2(void)`.
 * All descriptor strings and the port table must stay valid while the library is loaded.
 *
 * Lifecycle: create, then any number of configure calls, start, step calls, stop, destroy.
 * start/stop may repeat; configure may also arrive between steps or after stop. A module that
 * owns threads must have stopped them before stop() returns; nothing may call the host API after
 * destroy() returns.
 *
 * Threading rules:
 * - create/configure/start/step/stop/destroy are called by host worker threads, never concurrently
 *   for the same instance (an instance is a serial task). Different instances may run in parallel.
 * - write_begin/write_commit/write_abort may be called from step, or from module-owned threads for
 *   output ports flagged XGC2_PORT_ASYNC_WRITER (one writer thread at a time per port).
 * - read_latest/read_next/changed are only valid inside step; views are borrowed until step returns.
 * - now_ns, wake, log, report and set_period_ns may be called from any thread.
 *
 * Port numbering: every host API call that takes `port` uses the index into the descriptor's port
 * table (inputs and outputs share one numbering). Only xgc2_step_ctx.changed_inputs numbers the
 * inputs on their own: bit i is the i-th input port in port table order.
 *
 * Data rules:
 * - Payloads are fixed-size POD structs (no pointers) defined in the producing product's public header
 *   and identified by schema_id; the host checks schema_id, size and align when binding channels.
 * - State ports carry the latest value (readers always get the newest complete sample; writers never wait).
 * - Event ports are bounded FIFOs, lossless until full; write_begin returns NULL when full (counted drop).
 *   Event channels accept several writers and several readers (each reader has its own cursor).
 * - write_begin returns a pointer into a host-owned slot that stays valid until write_commit or
 *   write_abort; a second write_begin on the same port before that returns NULL. An output port the
 *   manifest does not connect is bound to a private channel, so it never fails for that reason.
 * - An input port without a producer reports XGC2_ERR_NODATA from read_latest/read_next. Within one
 *   step, read_latest returns the same sample on every call; read_next returns successive events.
 * - Configuration is a JSON object (UTF-8 text, NUL-terminated; length excludes the NUL) passed to
 *   create and configure.
 *
 * Versioning: minor versions only append to xgc2_host_api. A module may use an entry only if
 * host->abi_minor covers it, and the host refuses a module whose abi_minor exceeds its own.
