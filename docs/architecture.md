# Architecture

xgc2-module runs the modules of one entity in one process. This page describes how: the data path, the scheduler,
hot-plug, the clock and the control plane. The module ABI itself is `include/xgc2/module.h`; the manifest is in
[manifest.md](manifest.md) and the control endpoints in [control-api.md](control-api.md).

## Data

**Channels.** Every output port writes into a channel; every input port reads one. A channel carries one payload type,
fixed by the first port bound to it: schema id, size and alignment must match exactly for every later port. Payloads
are plain structs without pointers, defined in the producing product's header, so nothing is serialized inside the
entity and nothing is copied: a producer fills a slot in place (`write_begin`, `write_commit`) and consumers read the
same memory (`read_latest`, `read_next`). An output that the manifest does not connect gets a private channel named
`<instance>.<port>`, so a port can always be written and a consumer can join it later.

**Slots.** A channel owns one arena. A slot is a 64-byte header (sequence, producer stamp, commit time, pin count)
followed by the payload rounded up to whole cache lines, so slots never share a cache line and payloads are 64-byte
aligned. Header and payload of a slot are adjacent in memory.

**State channels** hold the latest value. The arena has `max_readers + 2` slots (default 10): at most `max_readers`
slots are pinned by readers, one is the newest, and one is free, so the single writer never waits and a reader always
gets the newest complete sample. A reader pins the newest slot on its first read in a step and keeps it until the step
ends; a second `read_latest` in the same step returns the same sample. Pinning is an announce-and-recheck on the
`latest` index (sequentially consistent), so a slot that a reader holds is never chosen by the writer. A state channel
accepts exactly one writer.

**Event channels** are bounded broadcast FIFOs of `queue_depth` slots. Any number of writers claim positions under a
short lock, fill their slot and publish it; every reader has its own cursor and sees every event in claim order. A
slot is reused only after every reader has finished the step in which it read it, so a borrowed event stays valid for
the whole step. The queue is lossless until the slowest reader is `queue_depth` events behind; then `write_begin`
returns NULL and the drop is counted per channel. A writer that claimed a slot and has not committed yet hides later
events from the readers until it commits or aborts (FIFO order); a writer that is isolated while it holds a claim has
the claim voided so that readers skip it.

**Readers attach when an instance starts** and detach when it stops, fails or is isolated. A stopped consumer therefore
never holds slots or throttles event writers; it resumes at the newest state sample and at the head of an event queue.
A hot replace is the exception: the replacement inherits the cursors with their unread events.

**Staleness.** When the writer's instance fails, is stopped or is isolated, its channels are flagged stale. Readers
still get the last sample, and the flag shows in `health` (`stale`, `stale_reads`). The next commit clears it.

## Scheduling

**Instances are serial tasks.** Each instance owns one cell in a fixed, contiguous table, 64-byte aligned: one state
word (queued, running, paused, dead, plus pending reasons), the input dirty mask, the time of the oldest unprocessed
commit, and the wake counters. A pool of `workers` threads (default `min(4, cores)`) runs the tasks. An instance never
runs on two threads at once, and it keeps no thread of its own.

**Reasons.** A task becomes runnable when a reason is raised on an idle cell:

| Reason | Raised by |
|---|---|
| input | a commit on a channel one of its input ports reads (sets the port's dirty bit) |
| timer | its period timer |
| wake | `wake()`, from any thread (module-owned workers, ROS spinners) |
| lifecycle | create, configure, start, stop or destroy was requested |

The step context tells the module why it runs (`XGC2_STEP_INPUT/TIMER/WAKE/CONFIG`) and which inputs changed
(`changed_inputs`, one bit per input port in port-table order).

**Coalescing.** Reasons raised while the task is queued or running only add to the pending set. Many commits before a
step cost one step; commits during a step cost one more step, never one per commit. At step start the dirty bits are
filtered against what each input still has unread, so a commit that an earlier step already consumed causes no step.
`health` counts the commits (`input_commits`) and how many of them were absorbed (`coalesced_dirties`).

**Run-next.** A task made runnable from inside a worker is placed in that worker's run-next slot instead of the shared
queue. A chain producer, stage, sink therefore runs back to back on one thread without a thread wake-up. A worker takes
at most 8 run-next tasks in a row before it serves the shared queue, and the watchdog moves a run-next task to the
shared queue when its worker has been busy for more than 2 ms. Commit as the last thing in a step.

**Timers.** One thread keeps a deadline heap. A period timer fires at `anchor + n * period` without drift. When the
host fell behind, the skipped periods are counted (`missed_periods`) and the next deadline lies in the future: a slow
step never causes a burst of catch-up steps. A module can change its period with `set_period_ns`; 0 disables the
timer, and the shortest period is 100 microseconds.

**Step budgets.** Every instance has a step budget (default: one period, or 50 ms without a period). A step over
budget counts as an overrun and the instance's health becomes `degraded`; the next step within budget clears it. The
instance keeps running.

**Hang isolation.** The timer thread ticks a watchdog every 10 ms. A worker that stays inside one module call
(`create`, `configure`, `start`, `step`, `stop`, `destroy`) longer than the instance's hang limit (default ten budgets,
at least 100 ms; lifecycle calls at least 5 s) is abandoned:

1. the instance becomes `isolated`: its cell is dead, queued operations fail, its readers and pins are released, a
   pending event claim is voided and its outputs are flagged stale;
2. the pool starts a replacement worker, so the other instances keep their parallelism (`workers.abandoned` counts
   the stuck ones);
3. the library is pinned: it cannot be unloaded, and removing the isolated instance does not call into the module
   (the instance record is deliberately kept alive, because the stuck thread, or a thread of the module, may still
   touch it).

If the stuck call returns later, its worker exits quietly and nothing else changes. Recovery is to remove the
instance; restarting the process is only needed when an operator wants the stuck thread gone. A module that returns
`XGC2_ERR_INTERNAL` from `step`, or calls `report(2, ...)`, is `failed` instead: no more steps, outputs stale, and
`stop` followed by `start` restarts it.

## Clock

`now_ns()`, the step context and period timers share one host clock.

* `steady` (default): CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
* `external`: one designated state channel of schema `xgc2.clock.v1` (payload: one native-endian `int64_t`, time in
  nanoseconds) carries the time. The entity's ROS edge module publishes it from `/clock` in simulation. Each commit on
  that channel updates `now_ns()` and fires the timers that became due, on the committing thread, so simulated time
  can run faster or slower than the wall clock and timers follow it. Until the first sample arrives the clock is not
  valid: timers do not run and `describe` reports not ready. The first sample anchors all period timers one period
  later; time moving backwards re-anchors them.

Producer stamps (`write_commit(port, stamp_ns)`) are in the host clock domain by convention; the host does not touch
them. Latency counters in `health` always use CLOCK_MONOTONIC.

## Lifecycle and hot-plug

Lifecycle calls run on the instance's own task: `create`, `configure`, `start`, `stop` and `destroy` are queued on the
instance and executed in order on a worker, between two steps, never concurrently with a step. A live `configure`
therefore needs no pause: the module applies it between steps and the next step carries `XGC2_STEP_CONFIG`.

A change to the topology happens at a quiescent point of the instance it touches. The host pauses only that instance
(no new step is dispatched), waits for its running task to return (bounded by `quiesce_timeout`, default 2 s; else the
request fails with `conflict` and nothing changed), applies the change and resumes. All other instances keep running.
Control operations are serialized with each other; a second one is refused with `conflict` while one runs.

| Operation | What happens |
|---|---|
| load / unload a library | `load` reads the file, checks the sha256 pin, `dlopen`s with RTLD_NOW and validates the descriptor. A file that is already loaded cannot be loaded again, because `dlopen` would hand back the code that is mapped, whatever the file contains now: ship a new version under a new file name. `unload` needs the library unused and not pinned. |
| add an instance | plans the channels first (all-or-nothing), creates the instance, starts it unless `autostart` is false. Any failure leaves no instance, channel or reader behind. |
| remove an instance | quiesce, `stop`, `destroy`, unbind; channels that lose their last port disappear. An isolated instance is dropped without calling the module. |
| replace an instance | the new library version must fit every channel the old instance is bound to (same kind, schema, size, align; a port the new module lacks may only drop a private channel). The new instance is created while the old one runs; then the old one is paused and stopped, the new one takes over the channels, the unread event backlog and the configuration, and starts. If the new instance cannot start, the old one is restarted and the request fails with a message that says so. |
| rebind a port | quiesce, check the new channel against the port, move the binding; an input of a running instance attaches to the new channel at once. |
| live configure | queued on the instance; the module applies the JSON between two steps. Period and budgets change without involving the module. |

Replacing keeps the channel slots, so consumers see one uninterrupted sequence of samples; only the replaced
instance misses the steps between its stop and its start.

## Control plane

The control plane is the XRPC `http.v1` profile on a Unix socket (the XRPC Rust SDK). The socket's directory must be
owned by the user running the host and have mode 0700; that is the access control. `GET /v1/describe` is the only
call that works without the instance id of this boot, which the host generates at start and every other call must
carry (`X-Xrpc-Instance-ID`); a client that talks to a restarted host is told so with `conflict`. Reads are computed
from atomics and never wait for a module. Mutations run on the SDK's blocking pool and may take as long as a module
call; the limits are the SDK defaults (32 connections, 32 calls in flight, 1 MiB per request and response, 30 s per
call). All endpoints and their errors are in [control-api.md](control-api.md).

`describe` carries `ready`: every required instance is `running` and not failed, every required input of those has a
running producer, and an external clock has published. The reasons are listed under `facts.not_ready`.

## Observability

No line is logged per step. `GET /v1/health` reports, per instance: state and health, the module's own `report`
detail, `steps`, `step_time` (count, p50, p99, max in ns), `handoff_latency` (oldest unprocessed input commit to step
start), `wakeups` (`wake()` calls), `input_commits`, `coalesced_dirties`, `timer_fires`, `missed_periods`, `overruns`,
`step_errors`, `spurious_wakeups` and `misuse` (calls against the API contract, such as a second `write_begin`); per
channel: `commits`, `drops`, `stale`, `stale_reads`, `lag`, readers and writers; and the worker pool
(`configured`, `live`, `abandoned`). Percentiles come from log-linear histograms with at most 12.5% error.

## Module author notes

* All lifecycle calls and `step` run on host worker threads, never concurrently for one instance. Reads
  (`read_latest`, `read_next`, `changed`) are valid only inside `step`; the views are borrowed until it returns.
* **Commit as the last thing in a step** and keep steps short: the consumer runs right after the producer's step on the
  same thread. Do not block on another module and do not wait for input in a step; use `wake()` to hand work back.
* A thread that a module owns may call `wake`, `now_ns` and `log` at any time and the write calls on ports flagged
  `XGC2_PORT_ASYNC_WRITER` (one writer thread per port). Stop the threads in `stop`; nothing may call the host after
  `destroy` returns.
* `changed_inputs` numbers the inputs on their own (bit i = i-th input port); every host call takes the index into the
  port table. An unconnected input reports `XGC2_ERR_NODATA`.
* Drain an event input with `read_next` until it reports `XGC2_ERR_NODATA`; unread events stay queued.
* `write_begin` on an event port returns NULL when the queue is full; the sample is dropped and counted. A second
  `write_begin` on a port before commit or abort also returns NULL.
* Configuration is a JSON object (UTF-8, NUL-terminated) in `create` and `configure`; keep `configure` idempotent.
* Report health with `report(health, detail)`; `2` stops the instance's steps.
* A crash in a module is a crash of the entity process: there is no memory isolation, only the isolation of time.
